    <center><h1>Code of Conduct</h1></center>
    <p>
        <b>Innerve</b> is dedicated to providing a harassment-free festival experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. Sexual language, imagery and nudity are not appropriate for any Innerve event, including talks, workshops, games, and other online media.
    </p>
    <p>
            Participants — including co-creators, speakers, sponsors and exhibitors — violating these rules may be sanctioned or removed from the event, without a refund, at the discretion of the organizers. 
    </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion
            </li>
            <li>
                Sexual images in public spaces
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
               Inappropriate physical contact
            </li>
            <li>
                Unwelcome sexual attention
            </li>
            <li>
                Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior
            </li>
        </ul>            
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the Innerve staff immediately. Staff members are readily identifiable by their ‘Innerve’ t-shirts, and will immediately contact one of the organizers to handle incidents. Innerve staff will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the festival. We expect everyone to follow these rules at Innerve, including all co-created events.
    </p>
    <p>
        We trust and expect everybody to be mindful of the fest area, the environment and our neighbors. Some areas and venues at Innerve are restricted for organizational and security reasons, and access depends on t-shirt color. Everybody is expected to follow instructions from Innerve staff at all times and respect closed doors.
